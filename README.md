# Welcome to the Game of MAX (*insert Evil Laugh Voice*) 🍻 


# Rules 📜
############

# Aim of the game is to not get the smallest combination of two dice, after players take it in turns to roll three times.
# Once you have rolled upto three times and are sent your score by the / 7 Gods that rule the 'Game of MAX' /, 
#      ..the person to your left gets passed the two die, rolls upto three times and collects their score, etc.
# Unless your roll includes a score of 2 & 1 (21) or a 3 & 2 (32), you roll both die again and continue until it is your third roll. And that is what your score is. 
# If you get a singular 2 or a 1 in the roll, you then keep that 2 or that 1 and it remains for the next roll. 

# 2 & 1 (21) is the best score, 3 & 2 (32) is the worst. 

# If you get 21, you automatically win and you * topup * alcohol into to the MIX cup. 
# If you get 32, you automatically lsoe and you * drink * the MIX cup (unless someone else also gets 32, where it becomes a DUEL). 

# P1: 4 & 1 = 41 vs P2: 5 & 1 = 51 vs P3: 6 & 1 = 61 --> (P1: 41 would lose in this case as it's the smallest)
# P1: 3 & 3 = 300 vs P2: 4 & 4 = 400 vs P3: 5 & 5 = 500 vs P4: 6 & 6 = 600 --> (P1: 300 would lose in this case as it's the smallest)

# If it is a DEATHMATCH (two people get 32 scores) so the first person to shout "CALL".. 
#      ..as soon after one person matches the other (e.g. 52 = 52), gets control. 
# ~ This mean they roll first and can stop at any point of the three of the rolls and that will be their score. Same other rules apply.

# SAúDE 🍻🍻🍻
